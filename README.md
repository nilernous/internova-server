# Go Service (minimal)

This is a minimal Go service scaffold created to initialize a Go module.

Run locally:

```bash
cd go-service
go run .
```

Build:

```bash
cd go-service
go build -o bin/service .
./bin/service
```

The server listens on `:8080` and responds with "Hello from Go service" at `/`.
